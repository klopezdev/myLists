      <p>
	It's a simple goal, but we make using lists easy and powerful. The most powerful feature of <span class="asset">myLists.com</span> is our text messaging.
      </p>

      <p>
	We offer a beautiful and powerful web application [you are here] and you can interact with us through iOS and Android apps... but we prefer simple text messaging (^_^)<a href="#/whySMS" class="in-text-link"><sub>Why text messaging?...</sub></a>
